> is a free and open source fantasy computer for making,

> With TIC-80 you get built-in tools for development: code, sprites,
> maps, sound editors and the command line, which is enough to create
> a mini retro game.

One can write games in a variety of languages (including Janet!) using
its built-in editor which has some support for Janet too.
