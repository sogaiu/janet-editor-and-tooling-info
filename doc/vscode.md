# VSCode

There are at least two extensions that provide some Janet support
available for VSCode:

* [vscode-janet](https://github.com/janet-lang/vscode-janet)
* [vscode-janet-plus-plus](https://github.com/CFiggers/vscode-janet-plus-plus)

## vscode-janet

This extension is the simpler of the two providing:

* Syntax highlighting
* Evaluation of expressions and files

## vscode-janet-plus-plus

This extension is based on vscode-janet with additions including:

* Formatting of source code
* Structural editing and navigation like Paredit
* Some LSP support bundled
